===========
Big Goals:
1) connect to DynamoDB on AWS, via Token Vending Machine
2) register new users with your service (configured by you)
3) authenticate users (optionally, over SSH)
4) call a really easy API for doing I/O to NoSQL DB on Amazon (DynamoDB), using a monomlithic DynamoDB Manager. 

This should have a simple, four part API to enable read, write, update on any table, any attribute. Helps get a programmer started doing really secure cloud I/O, in a highly-scalable manner.
